    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the
      persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>

    <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200
      square
      miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.
